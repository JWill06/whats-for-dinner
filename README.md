# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
I built an application that allows the user to get a random dish item whether that be a side, main dish, or dessert, as well as a full meal with all three. The application is solving a problem of letting users get random dishes to make instead of wondering what they need to make each night.

### Preview of App:

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This project in total took me about 8 hours to complete. I am about to start week 4 of Mod1, but I also had to repeate Mod1.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals of this project were to better understand html, css, and javascript. 

### Wins:
1. Understanding javascript a lot more. 
2. Being able to solve my own bugs/issues without too much help. 

### Challenges: 
1. Having an issue when the output of recipes would should and a button being deleted because of it. I had to utilize innerHTML and create a new div element to add the button back in after the page was cleared. 
2. I had some hard time trying to style everything correctly and it took me longer than I wanted to. I overcame this by realizing I had targeted parent elements already.
